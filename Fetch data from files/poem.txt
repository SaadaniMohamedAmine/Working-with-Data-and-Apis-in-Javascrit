The poem begins by depicting the dominant presence of the buzz‑saw before dwelling on the landscape for several lines. The focus then returns to personifying the saw that ‘snarled and rattled’, introducing a sense of menace and danger to the poem. Even so, there is also an atmosphere of work coming to an end and relaxation as the boy’s sister comes out to call him in for ‘Supper’.
At this moment the fatal accident happens. How does Frost describe the moment when the boy’s hand is caught by the saw, and the boy’s reaction? What do you think of the tone of the poem in this section, lines sixteen to twenty‑six?
